* Hello World Wide Web!

It has taken long time to make this happend, but finally i publish my first blog. Woww!!!.
It's really exicted to build a personal site to look back and see all the knowlage you get.

I want to share my little experience in programming and electronics. Apply these concepts in 
projects would be the main goal. It's always better to make things moving. With patient i'll
achieve. 

Let's get start...
